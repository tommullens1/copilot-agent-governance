# Copilot Agent Governance Template

This repository contains a practical governance template for Copilot Agents in Power Platform and Microsoft 365.

The template helps you design and document governance decisions in a structured and repeatable way, covering topics such as:
- Zone and environment strategy
- Default environment usage
- Tenant-level Copilot Studio settings
- Environment-level governance controls
- Data policies and connector usage
- Lifecycle and operational considerations

The goal is not to prescribe a single “correct” setup, but to ensure that all relevant governance topics are explicitly discussed, documented, and aligned with organizational risk and maturity.

## Intended audience

This template is intended for:
- Power Platform and Microsoft 365 architects
- Platform administrators and governance leads
- Technical consultants

Familiarity with Power Platform concepts such as environments, DLP policies, and tenant settings is assumed.

## How to use this repository

- Download the Word template from this repository
- Use the checklists to guide governance workshops or design sessions
- Capture decisions and rationale in the governance decision tables
- Treat the document as a living artifact that evolves as Copilot adoption matures

## Scope

This template focuses on governance and configuration design.  
It does not provide detailed guidance on licensing, billing, or cost optimization.

Copilot and Power Platform capabilities evolve rapidly. Always validate settings and behaviors against current Microsoft documentation before implementation.

## Feedback and evolution

This template is intended to evolve as Copilot Agents and the Power Platform continue to change.

Feedback, suggestions, and improvements are welcome.  
If you have ideas, missing topics, or lessons learned from real-world implementations, feel free to share them via issues or discussions in this repository.
